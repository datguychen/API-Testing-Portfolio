DONE Endpoint Validation:
- Verify that all expected endpoints are present and functioning correctly.
- Test for proper handling of non-existent endpoints (e.g., 404 response code).

DONE Status Codes:
- Verify that the API returns the correct HTTP status codes for different scenarios (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).

DONE Parameter Validation:
- Test various combinations of valid and invalid parameters for each endpoint.
- Ensure that the API returns appropriate responses (e.g., error messages) for invalid parameter values.

DONE Response Structure:
- Validate the structure of the response for each endpoint (e.g., JSON schema validation).
- Ensure that the response contains the expected fields and data types.

DONE Authentication and Authorization:
- If the API requires authentication, test the login process and ensure that authenticated endpoints behave as expected.
- Verify that unauthorized users receive the correct response (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).

DONE Error Handling:
- Test error scenarios (e.g., incorrect endpoint, missing parameters) and verify that the API provides meaningful error messages.

Performance (K6):
- Test the API under load to ensure it can handle concurrent requests without issues.
