DONE Endpoint Validation:
- Verify that all expected endpoints are present and functioning correctly.
- Test for proper handling of non-existent endpoints (e.g., 404 response code).

DONE Status Codes:
- Verify that the API returns the correct HTTP status codes for different scenarios (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).

Parameter Validation:
- Test various combinations of valid and invalid parameters for each endpoint.
- Ensure that the API returns appropriate responses (e.g., error messages) for invalid parameter values.

Response Structure:
- Validate the structure of the response for each endpoint (e.g., JSON schema validation).
- Ensure that the response contains the expected fields and data types.

Sorting and Filtering:
- Test endpoints that support sorting and filtering. Verify that the API returns results in the correct order and filters data appropriately.

Pagination:
- If applicable, test endpoints that support pagination. Ensure that the pagination parameters (e.g., page, limit) work as expected.

Authentication and Authorization:
- If the API requires authentication, test the login process and ensure that authenticated endpoints behave as expected.
- Verify that unauthorized users receive the correct response (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).

Error Handling:
- Test error scenarios (e.g., incorrect endpoint, missing parameters) and verify that the API provides meaningful error messages.

Rate Limiting:
- If the API has rate limiting, ensure that it is enforced correctly and that the API returns the appropriate response when the limit is exceeded.

Concurrency and Performance:
- Test the API under load to ensure it can handle concurrent requests without issues.
